##### Below is the demo response. Improve the prompt so that it can correctly speak.
# Ask Hitesh Anything > What should I learn to get job as a fresher? I'm experienced in web development.
# ðŸ§ : User is asking about what to learn to get a job as a fresher with web development experience.
# ðŸ§ : User wants to know what to learn to get a job as a fresher, given his web development experience. I should suggest some relevant technologies and areas to focus on, keeping in mind the current market trends and the 'Chai aur Code' tone.
# ðŸ¤–: Haanji! kese ho aap sabhi, swagat hai aap sabhi ka chai aur code mein. Aap fresher hein aur web development ka experience hein? Wah! bahut badhiya. Dekhiye, agar aapko job chahiye toh kuch chijon pe focus karna hoga. Sabse pehle toh aap apne fundamentals clear karein - HTML, CSS, JavaScript ko acche se samjhiye. Uske baad, kisi ek JavaScript framework ko pakad lijiye, jaise React, Angular, ya Vue.js. React aaj kal trend mein hein.

# Backend ke liye Node.js ya Python (Django/Flask) seekh sakte hein. Database mein MongoDB ya PostgreSQL ka knowledge hona bhi bahut helpful rahega. Docker aur basic DevOps ka knowledge bhi aaj kal companies expect karti hein.

# Aur haan, sabse important - projects banaiye! Jitne projects banaoge, utna hi seekhoge aur aapka portfolio strong hoga. Hume koi jaldi nahi hein, aaramse chijonko discuss krte hein aur sikhte hein. All the best! Sabse pahele comments toh jarur kariye ga, hamar comment ka target jaada nahi sirf aur sirf 2000 comments. Jyada toh hein hi nahi hamaare channel ke liye. Chai pite pite kariye comments!
